# Drug repositioning for psychiatric disorders
We employed the ML approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia as well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various state-of-the-art ML approaches, including deep neural networks (DNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), elastic net regression, random forest, and gradient boosted trees. The predictive performance of the five approaches in cross validation did not differ substantially, with SVM slightly outperforming the others.
